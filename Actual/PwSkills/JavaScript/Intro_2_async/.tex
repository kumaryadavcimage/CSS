Q. How Js handle the sync and async tasks ??
- Js is single threaded language but other language you can't incinate the multiple threaded parallel processing

// syncronise
console.log("start")
for(int i=0;i<1000000000;i++){
    // anything
}
console.log("End")

// Asynchronise
console.log("start")
setTimeout(() =>{},500)
console.log("End")

- function like setTimeout, setInterval, getElementById etc are not part of native part of Js, Depending on Enviroment capability can change

# Runtime Enviroment : 
Node Js is also Runtime Enviroment not the framework
JS is capality that collabreate the run time Enviroment

- Browser : Browser Provide the lots of thing and capability like getElementById,getElementByClass,setTimeout,setInterval,XML Http request Menas different type of Runtime Enviroment different types of capability to javaScript

- document.getElementById("_-R9faeTKGdyp4-EP1NbzkAQ_43")

# js two types 1st Native feature  and Runtime
- Because JS is single threaded, every natives piecs of code will always execute on the main thread and it will be always sync is native ex. if you have a time

consuming piece of code written by native js feature then it will be blocking 

- JS Native : sync(step by step,line by line execute ), Single threaded blocking

- JS Runtime : The Algorithm of the Runtime features are executed reside inside the Runtime, JS only know how to trigger those function

- The moment JS code encounteres a functionality which is a Runtime feature, all it does is trigger the request to Runtime and do not wait for the execution
