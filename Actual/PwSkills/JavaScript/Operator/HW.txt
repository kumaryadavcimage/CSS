Problem 1:
if NaN is never equal to itself, let's say that we want to write a function that returns NaN for something, but now how do we check if the function returned naN ?.

'''
function fun(){
    // does something
    return NaN
}
const response = fun()

// How to check if the value in response variable is NaN
'''

Q2.
If +0 and -0 and 0 when used with equality operatores always give the ans as true, how can you identify whether the sign of the 0  is + or - ? So write a function that can sompare 0 and -0 and if user passess 0 and -0 then it returns false And write function getSign() which takes a number and tells you whether it is pos or neg
