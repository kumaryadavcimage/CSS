## Tasks:
write three dummy functions without using promises and only uing normal callbacks,

All three functions are dummy, you dont need actual implement.
These duymmy functions are to just respresent a delay.

- write a function to download data from a url
- write a function to save that downloaded data in a file and return the filename
- write a function to upload the file written in previous step to a newurl

```
function downloder(url, cb){
    // write a dummy impl using setTimeout to show a delay
}

function writeFile(data,db) {
    // write a dummy impl using setTimeout to show a delay
}

functions uploadFIle(fileName, newUrl, cb){
    // write a dummy impl using setTimeout to show a delay
}

```

- The download should take say 4sec delay, filewrite should take 2sec delay, upload should take 3sec delay 
- write the above callbacks and use them in a manner that first download happens then writefile happens and then upload happens
